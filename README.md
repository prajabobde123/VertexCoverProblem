# VertexCoverProblem
vertex cover problem is solved using two approaches:
1. General version -where a vertex is selected and all the edges surrounding the vertex are deleted.
2. Polynomial time approximation - where an edge is selected and all the edgessurrounding the vertex are deleted.
Comparison between both the approaches is done by finding the time taken for execution.

Conclusion: second approach take less time than the first one
